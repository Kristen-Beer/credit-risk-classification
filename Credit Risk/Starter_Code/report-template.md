## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of the analysis is to create and evaluate accuracy of a data model that predicts credit worthiness of borrowers. 
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The dataset consists of 77,536 loans. The analysis predicted loan status.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy score: 0.99
  * Precision: Class 0: 1.0 Class 1: 0.85
  * Recall: Class 0: 0.99 Class 1: 0.91



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Accuracy score: 0.99
  * Precision: Class 0: 1.0 Class 1: 0.99
  * Recall: Class 0: 0.99 Class 1: 0.99
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
The Logistic Regression model performed best as demonstrated by the nearly perfect precision and recall scores.
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
